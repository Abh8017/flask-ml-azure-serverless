# CI/CD Pipeline for Machine Learning Project in Azure
Deploying a Flask Machine Learning Application on Azure App Services.

### Status

[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/marcoBrighterAI/flask-ml-azure-serverless/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/marcoBrighterAI/flask-ml-azure-serverless/actions/workflows/main.yml)

### Introduction
This project builds a **Continuous Integration** pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, and a **Continuous Delivery** pipeline
using **Azure Pipelines** for a Machine Learning Application. The app is implemented in python using scikit-learn and the
flask module. **Azure App Services** is used to host the application. In this repo you will find all the code and configurations
necessary to implement CI/CD. The ML application is simple, however, it can be easily extended.


### Dependencies
- [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com) 
- [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (Only if running locally)

### Project Plan
To follow DevOps best practices, in the links bellow you will find a Kanban Trello board, and a spreadsheet
showing the project plan, deliverables and goals.

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) 
3. Launch Azure Cloud Shell 

### Instructions
To run this project in the Azure Cloud Shell, follow the steps bellow. The same steps apply when running locally, however,
you would need to log into your Azure Account from the terminal first.

1. Clone the forked repo in Azure Cloud Shell
2. Create virtual environment and source
3. Deploy your app in Azure Cloud Shell
5. Verify Machine Learning predictions works
6. Verify Continuous Integration by changing app.py
7. Create a Webapp in Azure App Services
8. Create an Azure DevOps Project and connect to Azure
9. Create a Python Pipeline with GitHub Integration
10. Verify Continuous Delivery by changing app.py

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
